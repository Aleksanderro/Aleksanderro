Hi there! Rookie in IT world.
Looking for new challenges as a Python data scientist/Engineer.
Starting with scikit-learn -> Keras. Learning TensorFlow on my laptop to create a self-learning smart Home from my dreams.
Working around Arduino as a hobby inventor and electrical engineer. 
Going well with my first project to handwritten digits recognition.
